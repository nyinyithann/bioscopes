# Bioscopes   ðŸŽ¥ 

A site to browse movies and people from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).
<br/>Browsing TV shows are not implemented as of now and might be supported in future when I get some free time.

Live demo hosted on Vercel can be found at [https://bioscopes.fun](https://bioscopes.fun).

Built as a side project to learn [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/).
